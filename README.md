# SCIP 2022: Intro to Structural Biology 

## Hello and Welcome! 

I am very happy to be sharing with you my love for Computational Structural Biology. 
I have prepared a few jupyter notebooks that will provide you with a brief introduction to the field. 
The coding section of this tutorial is very brief, and focuses on visualization.  
My hope is that you can spend some time going over the links I provided and be exposed to all the possibilities of the field. 
Design your own proteins, learn about AlphaFold, watch molecular dynamics simulations, etc. 
I imagine this as your first step in your path to learn more about how all life around us is made. 


## How to use this repository 

1. Watch the class video here: [https://youtu.be/s7K2g9V2vTc](https://youtu.be/s7K2g9V2vTc)
2. Run the Tutorial on the Jupyter Notebook that you can find in this repository. 
   - Click on the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/fatipardo/SBioSCIP2022/blob/main/SCIP2022_SBio_NGLview.ipynb) 
   - Click on the [Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) button
   - Login to your gmail account and run the code!
   - Enjoy your structures!

3. In this repo you can find the answers to the questions from the first jupyter notebook. You can find them in the ['Answers' jupyter notebook](https://github.com/fatipardo/SBioSCIP2022/blob/main/SCIP2022_ANSWERS.ipynb). 


## What if you have questions? 

Please raise an issue in this repository. I will try to get back to you as soon as I can. 

## What next?

Preparing these materials was quite fun! I hope to continue adding tutorials and ways for you to keep learning about this field!
